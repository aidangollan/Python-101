This lesson is teaching you about if statements, as well as type conversion
When you type something into an input, it will always be a string
However we want to do math operations on this input, so we need to convert it to an int (float would also work)
type syntax:
To string: str(var)
To int: int(var)
To float: float(var)

The user should have these number scores correspond to the following letter grades
0 <= score < 60 : F
60 <= score < 70 : D
70 <= score < 80 : C
80 <= score < 90 : B
90 <= score <= 100 : A

IF syntax: 
if "truth value" :
    "code to be run"
elif "alternate truth value":
    "code to be run"
else:
    "code to be run"

Strings: 
"Enter your score here "
"The user's grade is a "
