This lesson will get you started on more advanced data types, such as lists
We will additonally be working on basic loops
Loop syntax:
for i in range(start, end, increment):
    code to be ran

while i < 100:
    code to be ran
    i += 1 (loop won't end otherwise)

List syntax:
    list = []
    list.append(1)
    list = [1]
    list.append(2)
    list = [1,2]
    list[0] == list[1] : False
    list.pop() : removes last element
    list = [1]

Strings:
"Please enter your name: "
"The people in the list are"
"The second person in the list is "
"The last person in the list is "

Example:
Input: "John Bob Stop"
Output: 
Please enter your name: John
Please enter your name: Bob
Please enter your name: Stop
The people in the list are
John
Bob

The second person in the list is Bob
The last person in the list is Bob
