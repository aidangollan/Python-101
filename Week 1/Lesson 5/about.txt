This lesson will teach you about dictionarys and sets
A dictionary is a set of key, value pairs, where each key has assigned to it a value
This can be thought of as assigning a score to each student
A set is similar, except it only hold indivdual peices of information
As in math, a set has no duplicate elements

You will also be using functions, a function is a piece of code that can be reused
an easy example function would be this one
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

For this lesson you will be re doing some of your previous work, but then adding onto it
Instead of using many if-else statements, you will be using a dictionary
The rubric will be the same
0 <= score < 60 : F
60 <= score < 70 : D
70 <= score < 80 : C
80 <= score < 90 : B
90 <= score <= 100 : A

You will take in a dictionary of student names as the keys, and a list of their grades as the key
I want you to output the letter grade for each student's overall score
I then want you to calculate the best, and the worst student
I also want you to calculate which scores showed up, and which didn't

Dict and set syntax
dict = {}
my_set = set()

dict[key] = value
print(dict[key]) : prints "value"
dict[key1] + dict[key2] = val1 + val2

Strings:
"The letter grade for " + name + " is " + grade
"The best student is " + name + " with a grade of " + grade
"The worst student is " + name + " with a grade of " + grade
"The scores that showed up are "
